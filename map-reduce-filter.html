        // explain in general what map reduce filter are
        //  array processing helper functions:
        //      map: for when you want to make a TRANSFORM (or produce a different kind of value) PER ELEMENT
        //      reduce: for when you want to produce a single value for the entire array (like max() or a sum())
        //      filter: for when you want a subset of the array based on some kind of logic (like person.age > 50)
        // IMPORTANT: THEY DO NOT MODIFY THE ORIGINAL ARRAY!

        // map
        // remember: RETURNS AN ARRAY OF THE TRANSFORMATIONS
        // lets have an array of tools produce the html versions of the tools as LIs
        // we will then set the inner html of my-li to be the result
        // NOTE: you could also use reduce for this type of transformation
        const tools = [
            {
                name: "hammer",
                qty: 3

                name: "spanner",
                qty: 2
            },
        ]
        // first let's see what is produced in a raw state



        // reduce
        // REMEMBER: RETURNS A SINGLE VALUE (can be a JS primitive or object, etc.)
        // let's use reduce to HELP in calculating an average for an array
        // we will use reduce to calculate the sum of the elements
        const testGrades = [78, 92, 63, 83, 100];

        // remember that an average is ( sum of elements / # of elements )

        // for reduce, the function is how it modifies the single value per element
        // and the 2nd argument to reduce is the INITIAL VALUE of the single value


        // filter
        // REMEMBER: RETURNS AN ARRAY THAT IS THE SUBSET OF ELEMENTS
        // use filter to produce those people who are 35 or older
        const people = [

                name: "Bob",
